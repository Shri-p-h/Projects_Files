# Telecom churn
No-Churn Telecom is an established Telecom operator in Europe with more than a decade in Business. Due to new players in the market, telecom industry has become very competitive and retaining customers becoming a challenge.
In spite of No-Churn initiatives of reducing tariffs and promoting more offers, the churn rate ( percentage of customers migrating to competitors) is well above 10%.
No-Churn wants to explore possibility of Machine Learning to help with following use cases to retain competitive edge in the industry.
PROJECT GOAL
Help No-Churn with their use cases with ML
1. Understanding the variables that are influencing the customers to migrate.
2. Creating Churn risk scores that can be indicative to drive retention campaigns.
3. Introduce new predicting variable “CHURN-FLAG” with values YES(1) or NO(0) so that email campaigns with lucrative offers can be targeted to Churn YES customers.
4. Exporting the trained model with prediction capability for CHURN-FLAG, which can be highlighted in service applications to serve the customer better.
help to identify possible CHURN-FLAG YES customers and provide more attention in customer touch point areas, including customer care support, request fulfilment, auto categorizing tickets as high priority for quick resolutions any questions they may have etc.
# ITSM Project
ABC Tech is an mid-size organisation operation in IT-enabled business segment over a decade. On an average ABC Tech receives 22-25k IT incidents/tickets , which were handled to best practice ITIL framework with incident management , problem management, change management and configuration management processes. These ITIL practices attained matured process level and a recent audit confirmed that further improvement initiatives may not yield return of investment.
ABC Tech management is looking for ways to improve the incident management process as recent customer survey results shows that incident management is rated as poor.
Machine Learning as way to improve ITSM processes
ABC Tech management recently attended Machine Learning conference on ML for ITSM.
Machine learning looks prospective to improve ITSM processes through prediction and automation. They came up with 4 key areas, where ML can help ITSM process in ABC Tech.
1. Predicting High Priority Tickets: To predict priority 1 & 2 tickets, so that they can take preventive measures or fix the problem before it surfaces.
2. Forecast the incident volume in different fields , quarterly and annual. So that they can be better prepared with resources and technology planning.
3. Auto tag the tickets with right priorities and right departments so that reassigning and related delay can be reduced.
4. Predict RFC (Request for change) and possible failure / misconfiguration of ITSM assets.
# FicZon Sales Prediction
FicZon Inc is an IT solution provider with products ranging from on- premises products to SAS based solutions. FicZon major leads generation channel is digital and through their website.
FicZon business is majorly dependent on the sales force effectiveness. As the market is maturing and more new competitors entering the market, FicZon is experiencing the dip in sales.
Effective sales is dependent on lead quality and as of now, this is based on manual categorization and highly depended on sales staff. Though there is a quality process, which continuously updates the lead categorization, it’s value is in for post analysis, rather than conversation.
FicZon wants to explore Machine Learning to pre-categorize the lead quality and as result, expecting significant increase in sales effectiveness.
PROJECT GOAL:
1. Data exploration insights – Sales effectiveness.
2. ML model to predict the Lead Category (High Potential , LowPotential)
# Spare Parts Inventory Management
	Business Case:
The case business case is on the inventory management. Keeping Inventory of spare in various service centre to the market demand is always a challenge as most service centres spends significant amount in spare parts inventory costs. In spite of this, availability of spare parts is been one of the problem areas.
PROJECT GOAL:
1. Create Predictive model for inventory forecasting so that service centre achieve JIT standards.
